The `multilevelPSA` R package provides functions for estimating and visualizing multilevel propensity score analysis (PSA) models. This package is currently under development in support of my dissertation work. However, the development version can be installed using the `devtools` package.

		require(devtools)
		install_github('multilevelPSA', 'jbryer')
