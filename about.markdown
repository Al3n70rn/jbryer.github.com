Welcome to my website. This is a place for me to share projects I have been evolved with. A little about meâ€¦ I graduated from St Rose in Albany, NY in 1999 with a B.A. in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. After completing college I worked at MapInfo for about five years and am now employed at Excelsior College. After more than 10 years as a software developer, I am now an educational researcher working on a doctorate degree in Education Psychology & Methodology at the University at Albany.

My research interests include the charter/public school debate, math anxiety, issues related to social justice in mathematics education, and cognitive components of learning mathematics. Also, given my background in mathematics and computer science, I have a strong interest is methodological and statistical aspects of research including the use of open source software for data analysis, especially R.

I am the proud dad to Gabriel and Miles and husband to Heather. My wife and I also have a photography business which can be found at [BryerPhotography.com](http://bryerphotography.com).

The design of this website has been modified from [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) and is hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) using the [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) framework. See [this blog post](/posts/2012-12-10/Markdown_Jekyll_R_for_Blogging.html) on how I use R Markdown with Jekyll.

Thanks for visiting, 
Jason
