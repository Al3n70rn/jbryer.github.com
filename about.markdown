title: About Me

<img src='/images/me.gif' align='left' style="padding:5px;"> Welcome to my website. This is a place for me to share projects I have been evolved with. A little about meâ€¦ I graduated from St Rose in Albany, NY in 1999 with a B.A. in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. After completing college I worked at MapInfo for about five years and am now employed at Excelsior College. After more than 10 years as a software developer, I am now an educational researcher working on a doctorate degree in Education Psychology & Methodology at the University at Albany.

My research interests include charter/public school debate, math anxiety, issues related to social justice in mathematics education, and cognitive components of learning mathematics. Also, given my background in mathematics and computer science, I have a strong interest is methodological and statistical aspects of research including the use of open source software for data analysis, especially R.

I am the proud dad to Gabriel and Miles and husband to Heather. You can view our family blog at BryerFamily.org. In my free time I enjoy taking photographs. I maintain a separate photo blog which can be found at BryerPhotography.com.
