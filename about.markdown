Welcome to my website. This is a place for me to share projects I have been evolved with. A little about meâ€¦ I earned my doctorate at the University at Albany in Educational Psychology and Methodology. You can find my dissertation on [Github](http://github.com/jbryer/Dissertation). I have a strong interest in R, reproducible research, and statistics driven in part to the fact that I was a software engineer for 10 years (working mostly in Java). Currently, I am a Senior Research Analyst at Excelsior College working mostly on grant funded projects. I am the Principal Investigator on a Gates Foundation funded grant investigating the use of adaptive learning technology in introductory math and biology. I am also developing a low-stakes formative assessment for incoming college students to provide feedback about students' strengths and weaknesses in key college skills including reading, writing, math, self-regulation, and math and test anxiety. My CV is hosted on Github at [http://github.com/jbryer/CV](http://github.com/jbryer/CV).

My research interests include the charter/public school debate, math anxiety, issues related to social justice in mathematics education, and cognitive components of learning mathematics. Also, given my background in mathematics and computer science, I have a strong interest is methodological and statistical aspects of research including the use of open source software for data analysis, especially R.

I am the proud dad to Gabriel, Miles, and Rowan and husband to Heather. My wife and I also have a photography business which can be found at [BryerPhotography.com](http://bryerphotography.com).

The design of this website has been modified from [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) and is hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) using the [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) framework. See [this blog post](/posts/2012-12-10/Markdown_Jekyll_R_for_Blogging.html) on how I use R Markdown with Jekyll.

Thanks for visiting, 
Jason
