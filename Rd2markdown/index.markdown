This package provides functions to convert R help files (Rd objects) to markdown format. [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) has become a popular format to prepare content for the web. With the [R markdown package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/markdown/index.html) and [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) markdown has become a first class documentation format within R. Moreover, the popular IDE [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) has [built in support for R markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/authoring/using_markdown).


#### Examples

Here are examples of the output of `Rd2markdown` for some R packages I maintain:

* [TriMatch](/TriMatch/docs/)
* [multilevelPSA](/multilevelPSA/docs)
