Looks like more audio book publishers are going the non-DRM route. What is interesting is the realization of the impact DRM has had on distributors. Much of the DRM attention by the media has been on how it is anti-consumer. However, forcing distributors to use DRM has created opposing formats that has locked consumers into a particular store. It is ironic that the very system that was to protect the record and publishing companies has been the source of their downfall. The records companies are currently attempting to kill the monster they created. Apple's iTunes has quickly become on of the top music retailer partly due to DRM. Going DRM free has generally been thought to be good for consumers, but if the record labels regain the same level of control the had pre-interent, could this end up being bad in the long run?
