I have started an [R Users Group](http://www.meetup.com/Albany-R-Users-Group) for the Albany, NY area. Hopefully we get enough interest that we can host a meeting in the next couple of months. Please feel free to share with your colleagues and friends.

Feel free to [email me](mailto:jason@bryer.org) or leave comment on this page or on the Meetup page if you are interested in giving a talk or hosting some future meeting.
