I have been working on a new package <a href="https://github.com/jbryer/makeR">makeR</a> to help manage Sweave projects where you wish to create multiple versions of documents that are based on a single source. For example, I create lots of monthly and quarterly reports using Sweave and the only differences between versions are a few variables. I have used GNU make and Apache ANT but wanted a 100% R solution. I will have more to write about that project in a few weeks. In the meantime I needed an example I could use publicly which led me to thinking about analyzing R-Bloggers. I wanted to use the RSS feed to get the frequency of posts and the tags and categories used. However, R-Bloggers, like most blogs, limits the RSS feeds to the latest few. Google Reader however keeps them all (or at least a lot more). The only downside is that you need to have a Google Reader account. The source code is hosted on Gist and provided below.
