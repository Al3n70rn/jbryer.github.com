<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1811"></a>The latest issue of <em>Innovate Journal of Online Education</em> has an interview with Trevor Owens, a technology evangelist for George Mason University's Center for History and New Media. Of interest is the planned 2.0 version due out in 2008 that will include server side functionality.<br />

<a href="http://innovateonline.info/index.php?view=article&amp;id=540">Innovate: Next-Generation Bibliographic Manager : An Interview with Trevor Owens</a>:<blockquote>James Morrison's interview with Trevor Owens explores Zotero, a free, open-source bibliographic tool that works as a Firefox plug-in. Previous bibliographic software, such as EndNote or Refworks, worked either online or offline to collect references and citations. Zotero leverages the power of the browser to allow users to work either online or offline and integrates citations with other research materials in a way that promises to reshape the way research is done. Zotero 2.0, due out in early 2008, will expand the potential of Zotero by providing server-side functions that allow for the sharing of bibliographies and accompanying annotations.</blockquote>
