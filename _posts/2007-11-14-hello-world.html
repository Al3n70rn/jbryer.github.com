Well, I've finally got around to updating my website. Instead of using a desktop application I've moved into the modern web and migrated to <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>! I've been using for my <a href="http://bryer.org/blog" target="_blank">son's blog</a> but really like how well it handles static pages as well. Though not as powerful as full content management system such as <a href="http://drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal</a>, Wordpress is pretty great.

Though I've tried blogging in the past, I seem not update very often. However, I'm going to attempt to use this format to keep some of my information organized, particularly as I find stuff on the web related to my studies in Educational Psychology.
