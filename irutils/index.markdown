### Overview
The `irutils` package provides utilities for Institutional Researchers. Many of the functions contained in this package have been moved to other packages including [`likert`](/likert), [`sqlutils`](/sqlutils), and [`retention`](/retention) to make maintenance easier. I apologize for any inconvenience.
